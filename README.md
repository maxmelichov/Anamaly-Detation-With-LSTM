Anomaly-Detection-With-LSTM
This repository contains a program that detects anomalies using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This is a powerful feature in time series forecasting where classical linear methods can fall short.

The program is designed to work on three different datasets. The details of these datasets are not provided in the excerpt, but they could be any time-series data where anomaly detection is required.
